## Getting Started

Bash aliases are shortcuts that help you execute commands more efficiently. By defining aliases in your terminal configuration file, you can save time and keystrokes.

## Installation

1. **Backup your existing `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:**

   ```sh
   cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile_backup
   # or
   cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc_backup
   # or
   cp ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc_backup
   ```

2. **Create `my_scripts folder if not exist and copy /scripts folder content`**

- Manually:
  Open a terminal and type `cd ~ && mkdir my_scripts`. and then copy the content of /scripts folder inside.
- Automatically:
  Use one of the scripts provided:

  ```python
  python installation.py
  ```

  or

  ```javascript
  node installation.js
  ```

3. **Append the [aliases](https://github.com/FranciscoDiazPaccot73/git-mac-alias/blob/main/ALIAS.md) to your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:**

```sh
nano ~/.bash_profile
# or
nano ~/.bashrc
# or
nano ~/.zshrc
```

or

```sh
open -e ~/.bash_profile
# or
open -e ~/.bashrc
# or
open -e ~/.zshrc
```

4. **Reload your Bash configuration:**

   ```sh
   source ~/.bash_profile
   # or
   source ~/.bashrc
   # or
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```
